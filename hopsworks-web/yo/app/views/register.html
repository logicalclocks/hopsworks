        <p> Hopsworks is software-as-a-service (SaaS) for Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Apache Hive, and Elasticsearch.
        </p>
        <b> Definitions</b>

        <ul>  
          <li>
            <i>User</i> – the data owner acting as the controller, the legally responsible party who uploads the data on the platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Hopsworks platform</i> – the processor who processes the data on behalf of the controller
          </li>
        </ul>


        <ol> 
          <li>
            <b>Legal basis for processing:</b>
            The law applicable to the processing of data is the law that applies in the country where the
            user is established, no matter where the data is processed.
            The user undertakes to strictly follow a research protocol and only act 
            within the limits of any given consent, alternatively any other legal ground within the applicable law, 
            for example a permission from an ethical review board to allow re-use of previously consented data.  
            In order to secure the above mentioned, the user is to provide evidence of research approval for each study processed within the platform, according to the forms set out in the platform.

            <ul>
              <li>SRPA: Standard Research Project Approval</li>
              <li>SIAC: Standard Information About Consent</li>
              <li>SINC: Standard Information on Non-Consented data</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br></br>

          <li>
            <b>Secrecy clause:</b>
            All personal data acquired by the Platform from the user shall only be used for the purposes of 
            this agreement and shall not be further processed or disclosed without the consent of the user.
            This does not preclude the platform from allowing access to auditing services under this agreement,
            or any legally binding requests for disclosure of personal data. 

          </li>
          <br></br>
          <li>
            <b>Transparency:</b>
            All processing of the data within the Hopsworks platform is conducted by the 
            platform itself. If any subcontractors will be involved in the future, the Hopsworks Platform 
            undertakes to inform the user in writing. If the user does not want to continue using the Hopsworks 
            Platform services under these conditions, the platform will take care to end its services under controlled forms, as set out in point 13. Termination of the contract. 
          </li>
          <br></br>

          <li>
            <b>Changes in the Services:</b>
            If in the future changes will be made in the service that requires the installation of new software, libraries or 
            hardware devices on the users systems, the Hopsworks will inform the user about this, and in particular about its
            implications from a data protection and data security point of view.

            The user agrees to provide the data subjects with information on where the data is being processed, in the event the
            data subject would want his/her data erased or changed. 
          </li>
          <br></br>

          <li>
            <b>Purpose binding:</b> 
            The platform will process the data in accordance with the instructions of the user. The user instructs the platform to:
            a) provide the services, including detection, prevention and resolution of security and technical issues, and 
            b) respond to customers support requests. 
            The platform will only process the data of the user in accordance with this agreement and will not
            process the data for any other purposes.

          </li>
          <br></br>

          <li>
            <b>Data minimization:</b>
            The access to data within the platform is restricted in accordance to different roles
            established within the platform. The user may allocate different degrees of access the data depending on
            which role a person acting within the platform is being attributed.  

            Other than the user, roles are attributed to the platform as an administrator and to ethics board or auditor 
            who may monitor the processing conducted on the platform on behalf of the user or the platform. 
          </li>
          <br></br>

          <li>
            <b>Retention periods:</b>
            When uploading data to the platform, the user shall define a period of time under which the data is to be stored (retention period).
            The retention period should not be longer than necessary to conduct the storing and analyzing needed. 
            If the user has not taken action to remove the data when the retention period has elapsed, the platform will contact 
            the user and request that this is done. The user may prolong the retention period, but only if this is in accordance with 
            applicable law. If the user does not either remove the data or prolong the retention period, the platform shall take action to 
            remove the data from the platform. The user will be given due notice before any data is removed.
          </li>
          <br></br>
