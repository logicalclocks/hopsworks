# HopsWorks
HopsWorks Big data Management Platform

#### Build Requirements
NodeJS server:

```
apt-get install node
```

## Build with Maven
```
mvn install 
```
Maven uses yeoman-maven-plugin to build both the frontend and the backend.
Maven first executes the Gruntfile in the yo directory, then builds the back-end in Java.
The yeoman-maven-plugin copies the dist folder produced by grunt from the yo directory to the target folder of the backend.
Both the frontend and backend are packaged together in a single war file.
