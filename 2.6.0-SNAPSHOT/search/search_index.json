You can also select Jupyter notebooks as files to be executed. When running a job, Hopsworks will automatically convert the PySpark/Python notebook to a .py file and run it. The notebook is converted every time the job runs, which means changes in the notebook will be picked up by the job without having to update it. Fill in a name for the job.

Currently supported channels are - email - slack - pagerduty Once you have configured the alert channels, you can proceed by specifying alert receivers from the project's settings page. Receivers are the destinations to which your alerts will be sent to. You can specify global alerts, which means these alerts will be triggered on job events regardless of which specific job generated the alert event. Alternatively, you can override the job alerts by adding alerts to a specific job from the job's configuration page as shown below. The job events alerts are triggered upon are: on job success on job fail on job killed The potential severities these alerts should report are: WARNING INFO CRITICAL Job alerts Edit & Delete # You can edit a job from the Job's overview page.

From the same page, you can also delete a job as shown in the image below. Please note that when deleting a job, Hopsworks will first attempt to gracefully terminate any pending executions of this job. All job logs will remain in the Logs dataset and it is up to the user to clean them up if needed. Job deletion Executions # You can execute a job multiple times concurrently with different input arguments. Each execution has an individual execution id that identifies it.

The difference between the two is that the latter will prompt you for input arguments whereas the former will use the default arguments, if any are provided. This page also shows a list of the most recent executions. For a detailed list of executions for the job, you need navigate to the executions page by clicking the view all executions link. Job preview Executions overview By default, a job can have a maximum of 10000 executions. This limit can be increased/lowered by a Hopsworks administrator. Monitoring and Logging # The executions page enables you to filter executions for the job based on the execution's date and state. You can view detailed information about each execution by following the various monitoring and logging links provided with each execution. In particular, you get access to the following dashboards/views for every execution: Spark UI: Applies to Spark/PySpark jobs only, a new tab will open showing the Spark application Web UI (see docs ).

Logs # It can be useful to look at the Jupyter server logs in case of errors as they can provide more details compared to the error notification that is shown in the Jupyter dashboard. For example if Jupyter cannot start, simply click the Server Logs button next to the Start or Stop button in the Jupyter dashboard.

Jupyter logs Auto-shutdown # Jupyter server is configured to automatically shut down after 6 hours. This functionality enables you to avoid excessive use of compute resources. You can modify the shut down limit by adding 6-hour chunks to the shutdown time. The dashboard also shows you how much time is currently left before the Jupyter server shuts down. Debug Jupyter installation # Jupyter is installed in the Python environment of your project. This means that if a dependency of Jupyter is removed, or an incorrect version is installed it may not work properly. If the Python environment ends up in a state with conflicting libraries installed then an alert will be shown in the Python libraries page under the Project settings menu. Jupyter + Spark on Hopsworks # As a user, you will just interact with the Jupyter notebooks, but below you can find a detailed explanation of the technology behind the scenes. When using Jupyter on Hopsworks, a library called sparkmagic _ is used to interact with the Hopsworks cluster. When you create a Jupyter notebook on Hopsworks, you first select a kernel . A kernel is simply a program that executes the code that you have in the Jupyter cells, you can think of it as a REPL-backend to your jupyter notebook that acts as a frontend. Sparkmagic works with a remote REST server for Spark, called livy , running inside the Hopsworks cluster. Livy is an interface that Jupyter-on-Hopsworks uses to interact with the cluster. When you run Jupyter cells using the pyspark kernel, the kernel will automatically send commands to livy in the background for executing the commands on the cluster. Thus, the work that happens in the background when you run a Jupyter cell is as follows: The code in the cell will first go to the kernel. Next, the kernel sends the code as an HTTP REST request to Livy. When receiving the REST request, Livy executes the code on the Spark driver in the cluster. If the code is regular python/scala/R code, it will run inside a python/scala/R interpreter on the Spark driver. If the code includes a spark command, using the spark session, a spark job will be launched on the cluster from the Spark driver. When the python/scala/R or spark execution is finished, the results are sent back from Livy to the pyspark kernel/sparkmagic. Finally, the pyspark kernel displays the result in the Jupyter notebook. The three Jupyter kernels we support on Hopsworks are: Spark, a kernel for executing scala code and interacting with the cluster through spark-scala PySpark, a kernel for executing python code and interacting with the cluster through pyspark SparkR, a kernel for executing R code and interacting with the cluster through spark-R By default, all files and folders created by Spark are group writable (i.e umask=007). If you want to change this default umask you can add additional spark property spark.hadoop.fs.permissions.umask-mode=<umask> in the Properties textbox of the Jupyter server configuration, before starting the jupyter server. In the rest of this tutorial we will focus on the pyspark kernel. PySpark notebooks # After you have started the Jupyter notebook server, you can create a PySpark notebook from JupyterLab: Create a pyspark notebook When you execute the first cell in a PySpark notebook, the Spark session is automatically created, referring to the Hopsworks cluster. SparkSession creation with pyspark kernel The notebook will look just like any Python notebook, with the difference that the python interpreter is actually running on a Spark driver in the cluster. You can execute regular Python code: Executing python code on the spark driver in the cluster Since you are executing on the Spark driver, you can also run applications on spark executors in the cluster, the Spark session is available as the variable spark in the notebook: Starting a spark application from Jupyter When you execute a cell in Jupyter that starts a Spark job, you can go back to the Hopsworks Jupyter service dashboard where you can access the Spark web UI and other monitoring and logging tools. In addition to having access to a regular Python interpreter as well as the spark cluster, you also have access to magic commands provided by sparkmagic. You can view a list of all commands by executing a cell with %%help : Printing a list of all sparkmagic commands Plotting with PySpark Kernel # So far throughout this tutorial, the Jupyter notebook have behaved more or less identical to how it does if you start the notebook server locally on your machine using a Python kernel, without access to a Hopsworks cluster. However, there is one main difference from a user-standpoint when using PySpark notebooks instead of regular Python notebooks, this is related to plotting. Since the code in a PySpark notebook is executed remotely, in the Spark cluster, regular Python plotting will not work. What you can do however, is to use sparkmagic to download your remote spark dataframe as a local pandas dataframe and plot it using matplotlib , seaborn , or sparkmagic 's built-in visualization. To achieve this we use the magics: %%sql , %%spark , and %%local . The steps to do plotting using a PySpark notebook are illustrated below. Using this approach, you can have large scale cluster computation and plotting in the same notebook. Step 1 : Create a remote Spark Dataframe: Creating a spark dataframe Step 2 : Download the Spark Dataframe to a local Pandas Dataframe using %%sql or %%spark: Note : you should not try to download large spark dataframes for plotting. When you plot a dataframe, the entire dataframe must fit into memory, so add the flag \u2013maxrows x to limit the dataframe size when you download it to the local Jupyter server for plotting. Using %%sql : Downloading the spark dataframe to a pandas dataframe using %%sql Using %%spark : Downloading the spark dataframe to a pandas dataframe using %%spark Step 3 : Plot the pandas dataframe using Python plotting libraries: When you download a dataframe from Spark to Pandas with sparkmagic, it gives you a default visualization of the data using autovizwidget , as you saw in the screenshots above. However, sometimes you want custom plots, using matplotlib or seaborn. To do this, use the sparkmagic %%local to access the local pandas dataframe and then you can plot as usual.

When using Jupyter on Hopsworks, a library called sparkmagic _ is used to interact with the Hopsworks cluster. When you create a Jupyter notebook on Hopsworks, you first select a kernel . A kernel is simply a program that executes the code that you have in the Jupyter cells, you can think of it as a REPL-backend to your jupyter notebook that acts as a frontend. Sparkmagic works with a remote REST server for Spark, called livy , running inside the Hopsworks cluster. Livy is an interface that Jupyter-on-Hopsworks uses to interact with the cluster. When you run Jupyter cells using the pyspark kernel, the kernel will automatically send commands to livy in the background for executing the commands on the cluster. Thus, the work that happens in the background when you run a Jupyter cell is as follows: The code in the cell will first go to the kernel. Next, the kernel sends the code as an HTTP REST request to Livy. When receiving the REST request, Livy executes the code on the Spark driver in the cluster. If the code is regular python/scala/R code, it will run inside a python/scala/R interpreter on the Spark driver. If the code includes a spark command, using the spark session, a spark job will be launched on the cluster from the Spark driver. When the python/scala/R or spark execution is finished, the results are sent back from Livy to the pyspark kernel/sparkmagic. Finally, the pyspark kernel displays the result in the Jupyter notebook. The three Jupyter kernels we support on Hopsworks are: Spark, a kernel for executing scala code and interacting with the cluster through spark-scala PySpark, a kernel for executing python code and interacting with the cluster through pyspark SparkR, a kernel for executing R code and interacting with the cluster through spark-R By default, all files and folders created by Spark are group writable (i.e umask=007). If you want to change this default umask you can add additional spark property spark.hadoop.fs.permissions.umask-mode=<umask> in the Properties textbox of the Jupyter server configuration, before starting the jupyter server. In the rest of this tutorial we will focus on the pyspark kernel.","title":"Jupyter + Spark on Hopsworks"},{"location":"compute/jupyter/#pyspark-notebooks","text":"After you have started the Jupyter notebook server, you can create a PySpark notebook from JupyterLab: Create a pyspark notebook When you execute the first cell in a PySpark notebook, the Spark session is automatically created, referring to the Hopsworks cluster.

You can execute regular Python code: Executing python code on the spark driver in the cluster Since you are executing on the Spark driver, you can also run applications on spark executors in the cluster, the Spark session is available as the variable spark in the notebook: Starting a spark application from Jupyter When you execute a cell in Jupyter that starts a Spark job, you can go back to the Hopsworks Jupyter service dashboard where you can access the Spark web UI and other monitoring and logging tools. In addition to having access to a regular Python interpreter as well as the spark cluster, you also have access to magic commands provided by sparkmagic. You can view a list of all commands by executing a cell with %%help : Printing a list of all sparkmagic commands","title":"PySpark notebooks"},{"location":"compute/jupyter/#plotting-with-pyspark-kernel","text":"So far throughout this tutorial, the Jupyter notebook have behaved more or less identical to how it does if you start the notebook server locally on your machine using a Python kernel, without access to a Hopsworks cluster. However, there is one main difference from a user-standpoint when using PySpark notebooks instead of regular Python notebooks, this is related to plotting. Since the code in a PySpark notebook is executed remotely, in the Spark cluster, regular Python plotting will not work. What you can do however, is to use sparkmagic to download your remote spark dataframe as a local pandas dataframe and plot it using matplotlib , seaborn , or sparkmagic 's built-in visualization. To achieve this we use the magics: %%sql , %%spark , and %%local . The steps to do plotting using a PySpark notebook are illustrated below. Using this approach, you can have large scale cluster computation and plotting in the same notebook. Step 1 : Create a remote Spark Dataframe: Creating a spark dataframe Step 2 : Download the Spark Dataframe to a local Pandas Dataframe using %%sql or %%spark: Note : you should not try to download large spark dataframes for plotting. When you plot a dataframe, the entire dataframe must fit into memory, so add the flag \u2013maxrows x to limit the dataframe size when you download it to the local Jupyter server for plotting. Using %%sql : Downloading the spark dataframe to a pandas dataframe using %%sql Using %%spark : Downloading the spark dataframe to a pandas dataframe using %%spark Step 3 : Plot the pandas dataframe using Python plotting libraries: When you download a dataframe from Spark to Pandas with sparkmagic, it gives you a default visualization of the data using autovizwidget , as you saw in the screenshots above. However, sometimes you want custom plots, using matplotlib or seaborn. To do this, use the sparkmagic %%local to access the local pandas dataframe and then you can plot as usual.

A Data Owner can invite other members by clicking Add members button on the right-hand side of the Members card in the general settings page. Then search by email of the user to invite. The figure below shows a project project1 with two members, a Data Owner (Admin) and a Data Scientist (OnlineFS). The role of a member can be altered at any time from the same screen by any Data Owner by clicking on manage members link.
