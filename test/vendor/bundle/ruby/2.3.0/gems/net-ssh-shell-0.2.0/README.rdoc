= Net::SSH::Shell

== DESCRIPTION:

Net::SSH::Shell is a library for interacting with stateful (e.g., interactive) shells on remote hosts. It hides (or tries to hide) the potentially complex Net::SSH state machines you'd otherwise need to write to interact with "su" and similar shells.

One of the significant benefits you get from this library versus using Net::SSH directly is that your shell is _stateful_. With Net::SSH, if you invoke "cd /" in one exec call, and "pwd" in another, the two are done in different shells so the directory change in the first has no effect on the working directory of the second. With Net::SSH::Shell, though, commands are all invoked via the _same_ shell, so changes in directory or additions to the environment all affect subsequent commands.

== FEATURES:

* Interact with login shells
* Support for "subshell" environments, like "su" or "sudo bash"

== SYNOPSIS:

In a nutshell:

  require 'net/ssh'
  require 'net/ssh/shell'

  Net::SSH::start('host', 'user') do |ssh|
    ssh.shell do |sh|
      sh.execute "cd /usr/local"
      sh.execute "pwd"
      sh.execute "export FOO=bar"
      sh.execute "echo $FOO"
      p=sh.execute "grep dont /tmp/notexist"
      puts "Exit Status:#{p.exit_status}"
      puts "Command Executed:#{p.command}"
    end
  end

See Net::SSH::Shell for more documentation.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* net-ssh (version 2)

If you want to use any of the Rake tasks, you'll need:

* Echoe (for the Rakefile)

== INSTALL:

This gem is available from RubyGems, so you can install it using the "gem" command:

* gem install net-ssh-shell

If you'd like to build the gem for yourself from source:
* git clone http://github.com/jedi4ever/net-ssh-shell.git
