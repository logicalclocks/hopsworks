/**
 * This handler is used together with a search (especially the scrolling search). Typical timeline is:
 * 1. perform search
 * 2. retrieve first page of results (in case of normal search it is the top K(configured) results)
 * 3. parse the results into instances of type R (using the provided parser)
 * 4. save (filtered) instances of R into the state S (maybe you want to save all Rs...maybe just some)
 * 5. iterate (go to step 2)
 * If you expect a large number of hits for the search (you are hopefully further filtering them when saving into
 * state S). Try to keep this memory under control.
 * For example: Do search, get page1, process page1  - iterate.
 * @param <R> typed opensearch result (parsed from BasicElasticHit with the provided parser)
 * @param <S> typed state that is used to collect the results from each batch. Same state can be used across multiple
 *          batches(for scrolling search for example).
